# Baby-Test-HTML-PHP
- My First HTML/PHP (mix) Coding Refresh! 🌿

I took my past university tutorial on brushing up memory skills of mixing HTML and PHP, understanding the concept once more. 💫

In this repo, I have learnt to code the following: 👩‍🎓💻
- Performing arithmetic operations with variables (+, -, *, /, %).
- Displaying outputs with **echo**.
- Mixing PHP with HTML to structure a basic web page.
- Adding line breaks in output using **<.br/>** (without the "**.**")


## GitHub Lesson Learnt 🔍📝 ## 
As a newbie GitHub, I'll need to reflect myself of understanding the configuration terminal in github!
- The suggested .gitignore file for this coding (PHP + HTML): (use framework-specific ones like CakePHP/FuelPHP if working with them).

## Extras 💡 ##
- Remember to handle division carefully (avoid dividing by zero).
- PHP allows mixing logic with HTML, but later best practice is to separate them.

  ## End of Lesson - Thank You! ##
